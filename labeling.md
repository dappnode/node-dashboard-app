## Labeling Issues

Issues are a great way to coordinate development activity. In order to have a common ground to decide on what to work on, this process document will help the team organize their work.

This document is based on [Lighthouse's bug-label/bug triaging overview](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/lighthouse/blob/master/docs/bug-labels.md)

Here are the different (actively used) labels and what they mean, organized by category bucket: 

### Priority Labels
- P0: Urgent issue- drop everything and deal with immediately
- P1: We want to work on this in the next few days
- P2: We want to work on this within the next couple of weeks. 
- P3: Good idea, useful for future thinking. 

### Process labels 
- Needs more information: issue that hasn't been prioritized yet because we need more information from the bug creator. If we don't hear back in 2 weeks, we will close out the bug. 
- Pending close: issue that we will soon close. 
- Needs priority: issue that needs to be prioritized by team (as P0, P1, P2, etc.)
- Needs investigation: issue that we need to dig into to understand what is going on (mostly for bugs)

### Type of incoming issue labels
- Bug: something is wrong on our end and needs to be fixed. 
- Feature: suggestion of new thing to implement. 
- Internal cleanup: nothing is wrong but clean up and/or refactor of the existing way we're doing something. 
- Question: question from community. Good fodder for new documentation that needs to be written. 

### Other labels
- Good first issue: for new external contributor, these issues can be useful for them to tackle. 
- Help wanted: issues that could use help from the community.
